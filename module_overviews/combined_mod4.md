## Instructors

Travis Rollins, Brian Zanti

## Module Content Summary

Mod 4 focuses on professional and technical skills designed to get your first job and ramp up quickly. Students discover, inspect, and refine the sustainable habits, processes, and knowledge that will power their professional software development careers.

## Technical Focus of the Module

Learning new technologies (React, Redux, Express, & GraphQL), understanding and navigating a large codebase, and becoming more familiar with computer science topics.

## Projects

- [Group Project: Capstone](https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/capstone.html)
- [Solo Project: Take Home](https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/take-home.html)

## Current project learning goals

Crate

- Learn and apply strategies for understanding how to analyze a larger, existing code base
- Apply strategies for reading and evaluating documentation
- Explore and implement new concepts, patterns, or libraries that have not been explicitly taught while at Turing
- Practice an advanced, professional git workflow

Cross Poll

- Ultimately, demonstrate knowledge you’ve gained throughout Turing
- Use an agile process to turn well defined requirements into deployed and production ready software
- Gain experience dividing applications into components and domains of responsibilities to facilitate multi-developer teams. Service oriented architecture concepts and patterns are highly encouraged.
- Explore and implement new concepts, patterns, or libraries that have not been explicitly taught while at Turing
- Practice an advanced, professional git workflow (see whole-team expectations)
- Gain more experience using continuous integration tools to build and automate the deployment of features in various environments
- Build applications that execute in development, test, CI, and production environments
- Focus on communication between front-end and back-end teams in order to complete and deploy features that have been outlined by the project spec

## Top three skills mentors should focus on with mentees

- Process of learning new technologies
- Problem solving approach / working through tech challenges
- Navigating a large codebase
- Extra: Interview prep

## Any things that mentors should **not** focus on or share with thier mentees?

- When working through technical challenges, don’t focus solely on just the correct answer. (Focus on their approach and how they break the problem down)
- With interview prep, make sure not to just focus on technical questionsl. Focus on both technical and behavioral, making sure students give specific examples and can gracefully exit if they are unsure of an answer.

## Common "gotchas" students encounter in this module

- Imposter syndrome especially when diving into a brownfield project or learning a new technology.
- Ignoring their process or approach when facing a new challenge.
- Can struggle with prioritizing and time boxing multiple competing priorities including the job search, projects, and PD deliverables/Gear Up presentations.

## How does this module’s curriculum fit into the program as a whole **(help mentors to understand the “why” behind what is being taught)**

After focusing on technical-specific content for the first three modules, Mod 4 is designed to allow students to improve their approach to software development that will lead to success in the job hunt as well as the job itself.

## Key dates (projects, mid mods, etc)

Crate

- Annotations Due Monday of week 2
- Code freeze is on Sunday of Week 2. (no adding new functionality, tests, or refactoring)

Cross Poll

- Starts Tuesday of week 3
- MVP and technologies decided by Thursday of week 3
- Due end of week 5.

Mid mods are in week 4.
