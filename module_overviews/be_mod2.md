## Instructors

Jamison Ordway, Kelly Murray

## Module Content Summary

Creating database-backed applications in Rails.

## Technical Focus of the Module

Creating database-backed applications in Rails, utilizing MVC pattern, testing using RSpec, capybara, and shoulda-matchers. Please feel free to reference the “Mastery” section of our [learning goals page](https://backend.turing.io/module2/success/learning_goals) on our curriculum site to see what we’d expect students to come out of mod 2 with at a mastery level of understanding.

## Current project learning goals

All project learning goals are listed on their project readme (linked above)

## Top three skills mentors should focus on with mentees

- Drawing out problems before getting started in code… diagram MVC, HTTP Request/Response, etc.
- Being able to debug, retrace error messages
- Research -- ask questions to yourself first, and use your resources to help you get to a solution (google, old code, peers, etc.)

## Any things that mentors should **not** focus on or share with their mentees?

- Knowing what we go over in Mod 2, we ask that you steer away from going down the “But if this were me right now, I’d probably do this… “ too early in the mod. Sometimes this can put too much in our students heads, and we need them to grasp onto a lot of small things quickly.
- Please do not show students any aliases for git commands, or use GUi’s.! We want them to learn how git commands work

## Common "gotchas" students encounter in this module

- From a studying point of view, I think a lot of students that didn’t gain study habits in Mod 1 tend to struggle in Mod 2 because there’s a lot more vocabulary-type content.
- Like most modules, as students proceed through the projects, we tend to get to the content in class just a bit slower than the timeframe in which they should start implementing features using that content. This sometimes causes students to go down rabbit holes in their code.

## How does this module’s curriculum fit into the program as a whole **(help mentors to understand the “why” behind what is being taught)**

By the end of the first weeks, students should be able to CRUD both a single and nested resource.They will know how to create a one to many relationship. They will have diagrammed out the HTTP request/response, MVC, and model interaction with the database through ActiveRecord.

By the end of the second week, students will have learned some basic HTMl, and basic information on sessions. They will know how to create a many to many relationship. Students will also learn about sad path testing and flash messages. During week 2, students will continue practicing basic SQL and ActiveRecord (find, where, order, pluck, etc.).

In week 3, students will build upon their basic SQL/AR knowledge, and learn about JOIN/joins. They will also be introduced to user authentication using bcrypt.

In week 4, students will build upon their SQL/AR knowledge to incorporate grouping and aggregating in queries. They will also build off of the authentication lesson, and implement namespacing in order to authorize users for specific parts of their application.

In week 5, students will learn about some rails specific resources such as resources (routing), and form_for.

We want students to use action view helpers as much as possible, but we have chosen to post pone the teaching of either intuitive methods (such as form_for) and rails specific methods (such as resource) in efforts to make sure that students know what those rails specific methods are actually doing under the hood. We want our students to be great at handrolling routes before using resources, and great at creating forms using form_tag before ever utilizing a helper that binds models to forms.

We will also introduce API’s briefly in this mod to allow for familiarity on the subject by the time they get to Mod 3. This is not an expectation of Mod 2.
