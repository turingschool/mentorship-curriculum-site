## Instructors

Tim, Kat, Mike

## Module Content Summary

In Module 1, students will learn to use Ruby and object-oriented programming to build software. They will develop skills to write automated tests, pseudocode, write implementation code, and refactor code to meet Ruby conventions. Through several large group projects and regular pairing exercises, students will learn skills and procedures for effectively collaborating and pairing with other developers.

## Technical Focus of the Module

Pairing, OOP, TDD, SRP, DRY code, basic data type creation/manipulation

## Projects

Week 1: War or Peace OR Flashcards
Week 2-3: Battleship
Week 4-5: Futbol
Week 6: Enigma OR Night Writer

## Current project learning goals

Week 1: Build a thing, get it to work, write code and build some tests
Week 2-3: Establish a git workflow and learn to pair
Week 4-5: Learn to work in a larger group, learn to test robustly, make design decisions, deal with inefficiencies in both tests and functionality
Week 6: Put it all together on your own to build a thing.


## Top three skills mentors should focus on with mentees

* Breaking down complex problems into smaller chunks
* Testing
* Mastery of objects/classes and common data types

## Any things that mentors should __not__ focus on or share with their mentees?

System level scripting (.zsh or .bash) - This generally leads to environment issues for the students.

Don’t help with Specific methods in projects - project design (modules, inheritance, class creation) is okay as this is generally foggy for students.

## Common "gotchas" students encounter in this module

* Assuming they are working with one data type when they actually have another.
* Too many instance variables
* General testing flaws
* Unable to break from unproductive struggle
* Uncomfortable choosing the right enumerable

## How does this module’s curriculum fit into the program as a whole __(help mentors to understand the “why” behind what is being taught)__

Students need to understand the foundations of OOP in order to start building more complex applications.

## Key dates (projects, mid mods, etc)

* Mid Mods: Friday Week 3
* Final Paired: Friday Week 5, Monday Week 6
* Projects Due: Week 2 Monday, Weeks 3 & 5 Thursday, Week 6 Tuesday
* Final IC: Wednesday Week 6
