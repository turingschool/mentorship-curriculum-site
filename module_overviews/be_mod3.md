## Instructors

Meg Stang, Bob Gu

## Module Content Summary

In Module 3, we will look beyond the basics of building Rails web applications with the intent of taking a business need and turning it into working software. Students will be comfortable using agile processes to integrate third-party APIs, produce APIs, build Rails applications that consume and process data beyond basic CRUD functionality, and improve the performance of their app through an optimization strategy; such as, caching, background workers, front end JavaScript.

## Technical Focus of the Module

- Produce APIs
- Consuming APIs
- Refactoring/Writing Quality Code with OOP
- Testing consumption and production of APIs
- [Lower priority focuses](https://backend.turing.io/module3/misc/learning_goals)

[Module Learning Goals](https://backend.turing.io/module3/misc/learning_goals)

## Top three skills mentors should focus on with mentees

- APIs consuming & producing
- Code Quality/OOP
- Testing

## Any things that mentors should **not** focus on or share with thier mentees?

Prefer mentors coach students toward answers rather than giving them a direct answer or giving them their previous project to reference

## Common "gotchas" students encounter in this module

Students sometimes get stuck in thinking there is only one way to solve a problem because they see it repeated.

For example, students often get caught up in following a facade design pattern, without really understanding the purpose of it.

## How does this module’s curriculum fit into the program as a whole **(help mentors to understand the “why” behind what is being taught)**

- Builds on Rails Foundation of M2
- Implements OOP principles introduced in Mod 1
- Focus on processes
- Students begin to do more independent research and develop a process of how to find answers
- Project Planning, Group Stand-ups, Project Retros
- Empowering students to be more self-sufficient as they transition into M4

## Key dates (projects, mid mods, etc)
