title: Back End Module 3

## Instructors

Ian Douglas, Dione Wilson

## Module Content Summary

In Module 3, we will look beyond the basics of building Rails web applications with the intent of taking a business need and turning it into working software. Students will be comfortable using agile processes to integrate third-party APIs, produce APIs, build Rails applications that consume and process data beyond basic CRUD functionality, and improve the performance of their app through an optimization strategy; such as, caching, background workers, front end JavaScript.

## Technical Focus of the Module

* Produce APIs
* Consuming APIs
* Refactoring/Writing Quality Code with OOP
* Testing consumption and production of APIs
* [Lower priority focuses](https://backend.turing.io/module3/misc/learning_goals)

[Module Learning Goals](https://backend.turing.io/module3/misc/learning_goals)


## Top three skills mentors should focus on with mentees

* APIs consuming & producing
* Code Quality/OOP
* Testing

## Any things that mentors should __not__ focus on or share with thier mentees?

Prefer mentors coach students toward answers rather than giving them a direct answer or giving them their previous project to reference

## Common "gotchas" students encounter in this module

Students sometimes get stuck in thinking there is only one way to solve a problem because they see it repeated.

For example, students often get caught up in following a facade design pattern, without really understanding the purpose of it.

## How does this module’s curriculum fit into the program as a whole __(help mentors to understand the “why” behind what is being taught)__

* Builds on Rails Foundation of M2
* Implements OOP principles introduced in Mod 1
* Focus on processes
* Students begin to do more independent research and develop a process of how to find answers
* Project Planning, Group Stand-ups, Project Retros
* Empowering students to be more self-sufficient as they transition into M4

## Key dates (projects, mid mods, etc)
