## Who to reach out to for help/concerns

David Whitaker

* Mod 0 Program Lead

## Module Content Summary

Foundational skills and tools that will help folks prepare for mod 1. OOP, data types, variable assignment, command line, git/github, iteration, and pseudocode

## Technical Focus of the Module

Giving students a foundation of skills and tools that will help serve them during their time at Turing

## Projects

* [Mod 0 Technical Assessment](https://mod0.turing.edu/assessment)
* [Mod 1 Pre-work](https://mod0.turing.edu/prework/) (done before, after, and during mod 0 ideally)

## Current project learning goals

* OOP
* Data manipulation/Iteration/Problem solving

## Top three skills mentors should focus on with mentees

* OOP is the primary focus of the mod 0 technical assessment. We talk about it in a program agnostic way in [Mod 0: Session 4](https://mod0.turing.io/session4/)
Focus is on:
1. Attribute/method interaction
1. Data types

* Foundational programming skills such as working with data types, conditionals and iteration are all used in the mod 1 pre-work
* Experimentation and problem solving. Students often want to read how to program, but the more we can have them work on little challenges, the better!

## Any things that mentors should __not__ focus on or share with their mentees?

* We don’t go over branching workflows yet, so if your mentee isn’t super comfortable with git/gh, probably don’t bring it up.
* No need to talk about more difficult OOP concepts like inheritance.

## Common "gotchas" students encounter in this module

* Time management is tough for some folks. Strategies around organization are always helpful
* Asking for help is something students really struggle with, providing guidelines around when to ask is helpful
* Asking questions. Getting students more comfortable providing context in the questions that they ask and using proper markdown to format those questions (if in slack)

## How does this module’s curriculum fit into the program as a whole __(help mentors to understand the “why” behind what is being taught)__

A good overview can be [found here](https://mod0.turing.io/)

## Key dates (projects, mid mods, etc)

* Assessment is due after session 4
* Mod 1 pre-work is due towards the end of the mod. Always weeks 4 + 5

## What to work on pre-Mod 0

* Mod 1 pre-work and similar exercises
* Mod 0 computer setup and session 1 pre-work (should be done by student on their own)

## What to work on during Mod 0

* Topics students are going over in mod 0 curriculum. Working through at a high level and addressing questions that come up
* And, as always, mod 1 pre-work and similar exercises

## What to work on post-Mod 0

* Mod 1 pre-work and similar exercises

After mod 1 pre-work

* [Back End](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-exercises)
* FE: TBD
