title: Front End Module 2

## Instructors

 Will Mitchell, Bob Gu

## Module Content Summary

In FE2, we look ‘under the hood’ to see how JavaScript is actually being interpreted by the browser, and gain a better understanding of what it means for something to be ‘asynchronous’.

## Technical Focus of the Module

FE2 focuses on foundational JavaScript, and the use of Array and Object prototype methods. Additional areas of focus include testing with Spies, and using the fetch API to make network requests.

## Projects

<section>
  <a href="https://frontend.turing.io/projects/" class="btn btn-dark">Front End Projects</a>
</section>

* Solo I - Flash Cards
* Pair - FitLit or What’s Cookin
* Group - Refactor Tractor
* Solo II - Overlook or Travel Tracker

## Current project learning goals

* Solo I - Use OOP, continue to work on TDD
* Pair - Parse data using prototype methods, display parsed data on the dom
* Group - Refactor existing code, fetch data from an external API
* Solo II - Prove an understanding of skills from the previous projects

## Top three skills mentors should focus on with mentees

* Pseudocoding
* Sad Path Testing
* Use of different prototype methods for solving the same problem

## Any things that mentors should __not__ focus on or share with their mentees?

N/A

## Common "gotchas" students encounter in this module

Students consistently underestimate the importance of pseudocoding, and instead try to just dive into the code without a plan for how to solve the problem.

## How does this module’s curriculum fit into the program as a whole __(help mentors to understand the “why” behind what is being taught)__

Understanding at a deeper level how JavaScript actually runs enables developers to write cleaner, more concise, code, and makes debugging a more straightforward process. Learning the various prototype methods is absolutely critical to success in programming more generally.
